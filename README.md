# Advent of Code 2023

The repo contains my first participation in 2023's advent of code. It's in JavaScript and without external help like AI or searching for solutions.

## Fast forward to Nov '24

In November 2024 I tried Gemini Flash to see if it could solve the first day of challenges from the year prior - and it could! Both part 1 and part 2 are included here. I did not attempt prompting the remaining challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

Every year, you get to solve a total of 50 challenges starting December 1st through December 25th, with two challenges a day. Want to take part?
